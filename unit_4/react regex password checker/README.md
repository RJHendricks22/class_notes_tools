# Password Strength Tester!

The 'net is a perilous place, and password security critical. How are we supposed to know if a password we're entering is secure, or not?! 

Fear not, we're building a password strength testing app. 

Some of the code is pre-fab, so you'll be filling in the rest to test the strength of the password. The stronger the password, the happier the emoji should be. 

A great password should contain an uppercase character, a lowercase character, a number, and a symbol (!@#$%^&\*)
